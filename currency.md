### ** Currency **

### **Currency:**
> In the context of data quality, the currency is how up-to-date your data is. Data should accurately reflect the real-world scenario it represents. For instance, if you once had the right information about an IT asset but it was subsequently modified or relocated, the data is no longer current and needs an update. 

These updates can be manual or automatic and occur as needed or at scheduled intervals, all based on your organization's requirements.
